# About 

This is a classic Rat in the Maze game.
You play as a rat trapped in a randomly generated maze, and your goal is to escape as quickly as possible.

The game is built with **Python** and **Pygame**. It uses predesigned maze sectors, which are randomly combined to create a large, unique maze each time you play.

While the game is fully functional, thereâ€™s still plenty of room for improvements and new features.

## How To Run

* Open CLI or git bash and type  ```git clone "https://github.com/ShubhamJain9674/RatInTheMaze.git"```
* ensure that you have latest version of python
* ```pip install pygame```
* Run the RAT_16_12 ```python RAT_16_12.py```

## Possible Improvements

* Movement scaled based on deltatime to have consistent input
* Loading and caching of assets
* Reducing magic numbers in the code
* Better structuring of the code with better abstraction and data encapsulation.
* Use of randomized prim based algorithm for truely randomized maze generation  
## Possible Gameplay improvement
* Dark scene with player having a torch can introduce an interesting mechanic to the game
